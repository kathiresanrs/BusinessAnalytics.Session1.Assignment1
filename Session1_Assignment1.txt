1. Say True or False for the below statements:

• Prescriptive Analytics used to predict the future outcomes?  
  TRUE

• Base R packages installed automatically?
  TRUE

2. What is Recycling of elements in a vector?

   In R, recycling of elements is when we perform operations on two different vectors having different lengths. 
   In it, the elements of the shorter length vector are used to complete the operation.

3. Give an example of recycling of elements.

   Lets assume vector1 has values [1,2,3] and vector2 has values [2,4,1,3,5]

		v1 <- c(1,2,3)  
		v2 <- c(2,4,1,3,5)  
		print(v1*v2)  

     In order to perform this multiplication, R would internally recycle the elements of the shorter lenght vector to suit the length of the longer one and complete the operation.
     Here, vector v1's elements( 1 and 2) are recycled to match the length of v2 as shown below to complete the requested operation.
                v1 <- c(1,2,3,1,2)
                v2 <- c(2,4,1,3,5)

    print(v1*v2)  would yield [1]   2 8 3 3 10
